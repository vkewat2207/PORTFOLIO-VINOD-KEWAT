                <p><b>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</b><br>

                    Description: A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to
                    create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key
                    encryption. The purpose of a PKI is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information for
                    a range of network activities such as e-commerce, internet banking and confidential email.

                <p><b>MKA/MACSEC (MacSec key Agreement Protocol)</b><br>
                    Description : MKA is a key establishment control protocol, which is required to generate one or more
                    Secure Association Keys (SAKs), which are the secret keys that IEEE 802.1AE uses to encrypt data
                    packets on the LAN. As part of MKA module, I was responsible for module sustenance and development
                    of features like:
                    Distribute a fresh Security Association key when key membership changes.
                    Added support for data delay protection.

                    Description: Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a framework for intelligently
                    controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, auditing usage, and providing the
                    information necessary to bill for services. These combined processes are considered important for
                    effective network management and security.
                    As part of AAA, my work revolved around sustenance of the module and developing identity management
                    features listed below:
                    a.) Scaled ldap client solution to handle multi-round concurrent request.
                    b.) Added Nested User Group Support in LDAP Client.
                    c.) AD DOWN SUPPORT.</p>

                <h4> Project #6</h4>
                <p><b>Bus Reservation System</b><br>
                    Description: This system is built on the concept of booking bus tickets in advance. The user can check the bus schedule, book tickets, cancel reservations, and check the bus status board using this system. When purchasing tickets, the user must first enter the bus number, after which the system will display the entire number of bus seats along with the passengers’ names, and the user must then enter the number of tickets, seat number, and person’s name.
                    We will be using arrays, if-else logic, loop statements, and various functions like login(), cancel(), etc. to implement the project.
