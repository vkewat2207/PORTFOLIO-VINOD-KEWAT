                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often
                        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                        JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
                        render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
                        semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
                        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                        objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means
                        to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
                        paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
                        using angle brackets. Tags such as images and input color name id directly introduce content
                        into the page.
                        Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include
                        sub-element tags.
                        Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and
                        styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects
                        such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
                        alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors,
                        and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed]
                        provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
                        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                        file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
                        file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
                        formatting.

                        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                        speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules
                        for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>

                    <h3>WEB DESIGN</h3>
                    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

                        Description: A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. The purpose of a PKI is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities such as e-commerce, internet banking and confidential email.

                        Description : MKA is a key establishment control protocol, which is required to generate one or more Secure Association Keys (SAKs), which are the secret keys that IEEE 802.1AE uses to encrypt data packets on the LAN.  As part of MKA module, I was responsible for module sustenance and development of features like:
                        Distribute a fresh Security Association key when key membership changes.
                        Added support for data delay protection.
